[![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Python-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=python)](https://www.python.org/)

A secure, versatile, and sandboxed Python code execution service exposed via a simple RESTful API. This project allows you to safely execute untrusted Python code in an isolated environment, complete with support for file attachments, standard input, and retrieving output files.

---

## ‚ú® Live Demo

This application is deployed and live on Render. You can start making requests immediately to the base URL:

**`https://python-execution.onrender.com`**

The documentation and a user-friendly interface are available at the base URL.

> **Note:** The public API is open to everyone but is rate-limited to ensure fair usage and server stability. Please see the [Limits & Restrictions](#-limits--restrictions) section for more details.

## üöÄ Features

-   **Secure Sandboxing**: Code is executed in an isolated, temporary environment with no network access and restricted filesystem permissions.
-   **File I/O**: Attach files to your request, process them in your script, and retrieve generated output files.
-   **Resource Limiting**: Strict limits on execution time, code length, and process creation prevent abuse and infinite loops.
-   **Curated Libraries**: Access a safe, curated list of popular libraries like `numpy` and `Pillow`, while blocking dangerous modules like `os` or `subprocess`.
-   **Detailed Responses**: Get rich context with every request, including your current quota, server load, and request metadata.
-   **Rate Limiting**: Per-IP rate limiting and daily quotas to prevent spam and ensure fair usage.
-   **Concurrency Control**: The server actively manages load, returning a `503 Service Busy` error if too many processes are running concurrently.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Model

Security is the primary design goal. Every execution is constrained by:
-   **No Network Access**: Scripts are blocked from making any outbound network calls.
-   **Filesystem Isolation**: Code runs within a temporary directory that is permanently deleted after execution. It has no access to the host filesystem.
-   **Import Restrictions**: An allowlist of safe modules prevents the use of potentially harmful libraries.
-   **Process Limits**: Protection against "fork bombs" by limiting the number of child processes a script can create.
-   **Ephemeral Environment**: The entire execution context is destroyed after each API call, ensuring no data persists between requests.

## üíª Usage Examples

### Simple cURL Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://python-execution.onrender.com/execute \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "code": "print(\"Hello from the sandbox!\")"
}'
```

### Advanced Example: Image Grayscaling with Python

This example uploads an image, uses the **Pillow** library to convert it to grayscale, and returns the processed image.

#### 1. The Sandbox Script (sent in the `code` field)
```python
from PIL import Image

try:
    # 'input_photo.jpg' is the filename we specify in the attachment
    with Image.open('input_photo.jpg') as img:
        grayscale_img = img.convert('L')
        # This is the file we ask the API to return
        grayscale_img.save('output_grayscale.png')
        print("Image successfully converted to grayscale.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

#### 2. The Client-Side Request Script (run locally)
```python
import requests
import base64
import json

API_URL = 'https://python-execution.onrender.com/execute'
LOCAL_IMAGE_PATH = 'my_photo.jpg' # Make sure this file exists locally
RESULT_IMAGE_PATH = 'result_grayscale.png'

# The sandbox script from step 1
sandbox_code = """
from PIL import Image
try:
    with Image.open('input_photo.jpg') as img:
        grayscale_img = img.convert('L')
        grayscale_img.save('output_grayscale.png')
        print("Image successfully converted to grayscale.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
"""

# 1. Read local image and Base64 encode it
with open(LOCAL_IMAGE_PATH, "rb") as image_file:
    b64_content = base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode('utf-8')

# 2. Construct the API payload
payload = {
    "code": sandbox_code,
    "attachments": [{
        "filename": "input_photo.jpg",
        "content_base_64": b64_content
    }],
    "return_files": ["output_grayscale.png"]
}

# 3. Send the request
response = requests.post(API_URL, json=payload)
response_data = response.json()

# 4. Process the new, detailed response structure
print(f"API Response Code: {response.status_code}")

if response.status_code == 200:
    print("API Call Successful!")
    user_info = response_data.get('user_info', {})
    exec_details = response_data.get('execution_details', {})
    
    print(f"  > Requests remaining today: {user_info.get('requests_remaining_today', 'N/A')}")
    print(f"  > Stdout: {exec_details.get('stdout', '').strip()}")
    
    output_files = exec_details.get('output_files', {})
    file_info = output_files.get('output_grayscale.png', {})
    b64_image_content = file_info.get('content_base64')

    if b64_image_content:
        grayscale_data = base64.b64decode(b64_image_content)
        with open(RESULT_IMAGE_PATH, "wb") as f:
            f.write(grayscale_data)
        print(f"  > Success! Grayscale image saved to '{RESULT_IMAGE_PATH}'")
    else:
        print(f"  > Error returning file: {file_info.get('error', 'Unknown file error')}")
else:
    print("API Error Details:")
    print(json.dumps(response_data, indent=2))
```

## üîß Local Development & Deployment

### Prerequisites
-   Python 3.8+ (Python 3.12 recommended for stability)
-   `pip` and `venv`

### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Bhargavxyz738/Python_exeution.git
    cd Python-execution
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # For Unix/macOS
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuration
For admin access (bypassing rate limits and import restrictions), set the `PYTHON_EXE_KEY` environment variable.

```bash
# For Unix/macOS
export PYTHON_EXE_KEY="your-secret-api-key"

# For Windows
set PYTHON_EXE_KEY="your-secret-api-key"
```

### Running the Server
```bash
# For development
python app.py

# For production (using Gunicorn)
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
```
The server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
